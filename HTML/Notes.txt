Inheritence in CSS

Children tag inherit properties from parent tag
Example:
body{
    color:green;
}
Then every tag inside body will have color green.

Certain elements does not inherit. To make them inherit,
color: inherit

If an element is inline, it does not have effect on width and height. We cannot set custom width and height.
But if an element is inline-block, we can set custom width and height.

width:50% - Half the width of parent element

1em - Font size of parent
2em - Twice the font size of parent

rem - realtive to root html element
If the root font size is 20px, then 1rem is always 20px. 2 rem is always 40px
